| About<br><br> üëã Graduated in Agronomy from UFSC, I had my first contact with technology during my academic journey, working with data analysis in research groups and scientific projects.<br> Three years ago, I began my transition to the technology field and am now close to completing my degree in Systems Analysis and Development (ADS), where I discovered my passion for Full Stack Development, combining Back End and Front End in integrated projects.<br> I developed a strong interest in Java by creating robust and scalable applications in academic projects, utilizing the Spring Framework (Spring Boot, Spring Data, Spring Security). I also explored React and Angular, building dynamic and structured interfaces. Additionally, I gained experience with SQL databases (PostgreSQL and MySQL), consolidating my expertise.<br> During my remote internship at Logicalis, a global company in the information technology sector, I deepened my knowledge in Networks and Cybersecurity, earning certifications such as FCA and FCF, among others. I also acquired experience with tools from Fortinet and Cisco manufacturers.<br><br> üîç **Professional Goal**:<br> I am determined to secure my first opportunity as a Full Stack Developer. My goal is to grow as a developer, refine my technical and interpersonal skills, contribute to innovative and impactful technological solutions, and continue learning and sharing knowledge. |
